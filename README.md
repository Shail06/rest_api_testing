## Introduction

* The Automated Test framework aims to thoroughly test the Order Creation API.
* The framework is written in **python3** and utilises modules like **behave**, **requests**
* The Tests have been written using **BDD** (Behavior Driven Development) way as *Given, When, Then* format
* The project generates test reports in HTML and Allure ( requires local installation of allure)

### Setup & Execution Instructions

There are two ways to run the tests:

#### 1. Running on Local Machine

**Requirements**: python3, pip3, [allure](https://allurereport.org/docs/install/) ( allure requires Java version 8+)

* [ ] Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shail06/rest_api_testing.git`
* [ ] Change Directory: `cd rest_api_testing`
* [ ] Install python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* [ ] Run the Tests: `python3 runner.py`  *This generates Results (HTML & ALLURE) under `test-report` directory.*
* [ ] Generate Reports: `allure serve test-report/allure-results`
  * This automatically opens allure web portal showing all the Test Results. If not, see the Link in Logs (something like *Server started at http://127.0.0.1:PORT/*)

**NOTE**: The test results are also available in plain HTML format in `report.html` but allure reports are more comprehensive.

#### 2. Running in Docker Container

All the above dependencies/packages installation on local machine (like allure, python3, pip3, java etc.) can be avoided using this method.

**Requirements:** docker

* [ ] Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shail06/rest_api_testing.git`
* [ ] Change Directory: `cd rest_api_testing`
* [ ] Build Docker Image: `docker build -t rest_api_testing .`
* [ ] Run Tests: `docker run -it -p 9090:9090 --rm rest_api_testing`
  * This will run the tests and show allure logs where you can find the link to view the report ([http://127.0.0.1:9090](http://127.0.0.1:9090))

### Test approach and strategy

See the [test_strategy.md](docs/test_strategy.md)

### Bug Reports

For bugs and issues found, see the [bug_reports.md](docs/bug_reports.md)

### Assumptions / Limitations

* The tests are limited to inputs based on the provided schema.
* The tests assume `total_amount` calculation for expected outcome as `total_amount = quantity * price_per_unit * (1 - discount_rate)`
* The test is limited to scope of functional, & non-functional tests but doesn't cover extreme load/stress testing of API
* The test assumes that the response time has SLA( Service Level agreement) of < 500ms.
